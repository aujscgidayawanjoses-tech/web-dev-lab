    <h2>How It All Started</h2>
    <section class="box box-light">
      <p>
        Cozy Blend began with two dreamers who found comfort in late-night cups and early morning talks.
        Between laughter and study breaks, they discovered that coffee wasn’t just about taste—it was about 
        togetherness. What started as a small hobby soon grew into a dream: to create a space where every sip 
        feels like home. Each cup celebrates warmth, love, and the joy of sharing simple moments.
