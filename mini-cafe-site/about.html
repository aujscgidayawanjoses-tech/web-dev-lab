    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <section class="box box-light">
      <p>
        Cozy Blend Café started as a simple dream between two love birds who shared a love for coffee and good vibes. 
        From late-night brainstorming sessions to endless cups of espresso, we realized that coffee isn't just 
        about the drink — it's about the moments it creates.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, we aim to bring warmth, happiness, and a little bit of magic to every sip you take. 
        It's not just a café — it’s your cozy little escape from the rush of everyday life.
